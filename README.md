ML Model for Osteoporosis and Osteopenia in Daibetes Cohort
# A Machine Learning Based Study to Assess Bone Health in a Diabetic Cohort 
Diabetes mellitus (DM) and osteoporosis/osteopenia affect millions of people globally and are major health conditions in 
several countries including Qatar. Bone mineral density (BMD) is a widely accepted indicator for diagnosing osteoporosis (OP) 
and osteopenia (OPN). The best method for determining bone mineral density and OP/OPN risk is via dual energy X-ray absorp-tiometry (DXA) technology. 
The risk of osteoporosis-related fracture may increase for people with diabetes. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a system that can support the 
early detection of OP/OPN in diabetic patients.
